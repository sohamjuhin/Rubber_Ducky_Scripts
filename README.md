# Rubber_Ducky_Scripts
Rubber_Ducky_Scripts
Rubber Ducky is a popular USB device that emulates a keyboard and can be used for various purposes,
including automation and penetration testing. While it typically uses a specialized scripting language, 
you can write Python scripts that emulate Rubber Ducky-like behavior on a regular keyboard

In this code, we use the keyboard library in Python to simulate keystrokes. 
The type_keystrokes() function takes a list of keystrokes as input and emulates typing them out one by one, with a small delay between each keystroke.

The code keystrokes include regular text ("Hello, world!","This is a test") and a special command ("DELAY 1") that introduces a delay of 1 second between keystrokes.
You can customize the keystrokes according to your specific requirements.

#To run this script, make sure you have the keyboard library installed. You can install it using the following command:
pip install keyboard

#Save the script to a file, such as rubber_ducky.py, and then run it using Python
python rubber_ducky.py

The script will emulate the specified keystrokes, typing them out with the specified delays.
Please note that this is a simplified example, and Rubber Ducky devices often offer more advanced functionality and features.

To use the Raspberry Pi Pico, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Set up the Raspberry Pi Pico:
   - Install the Thonny Python IDE on your computer.
   - Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer using a micro USB cable.
   - Put the Raspberry Pi Pico in bootloader mode by holding down the BOOTSEL button while connecting the USB cable.
   - The Raspberry Pi Pico should appear as a removable storage device on your computer.

2. Write the Python code:
   - Open Thonny Python IDE on your computer.
   - Write your Python code in the editor window.

3. Upload the code to the Raspberry Pi Pico:
   - Click on the "Run" button in Thonny to run the code.
   - Thonny will prompt you to select the device. Choose the Raspberry Pi Pico.
   - Thonny will compile and upload the code to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
   - Once uploaded, the code will start running on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Note: The code you provided is for emulating keystrokes using the keyboard library in Python. Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller board, and the keyboard library may not be compatible with it. To use the Raspberry Pi Pico, you would typically write code using the MicroPython programming language.

To get started with Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython, you can follow the official documentation provided by Raspberry Pi Foundation. It includes instructions on setting up the development environment, writing and uploading MicroPython code, and using the various features of the board.
